## Pre-Recording Setup

1. **Clean desktop:** Hide all personal files, use a clean wallpaper (default macOS or minimal)
2. **Menu bar:** Only show essentials — MuttR icon should be clearly visible
3. **Apps open:** Have a few natural apps ready — Notes, Messages, Gmail in Safari, a Google Doc
4. **MuttR running:** Settings configured, overlay working
5. **Screen recording tool:** QuickTime Player (built-in) or OBS for higher quality
6. **Microphone:** Use a good mic for the voiceover — AirPods won't cut it. Even a basic USB mic is fine.
7. **Record voiceover separately:** Record the screen first, then record voiceover to match. This gives cleaner audio and lets you re-record lines.

## Script

> **Note:** Drew reads the voiceover. Bracketed text `[like this]` describes what's happening on screen. The voiceover should feel natural and conversational — like you're showing a friend, not presenting to investors.

### INTRO (0:00 - 0:10)

**[Screen: Clean Mac desktop. MuttR icon visible in menu bar.]**

**Drew:** "I type thousands of words a day. Emails, messages, documents — it never ends. So I built MuttR."

---

### THE PITCH (0:10 - 0:18)

**[Screen: Click MuttR menu bar icon. Menu drops down showing status.]**

**Drew:** "MuttR lets you talk instead of type — anywhere on your Mac. And everything stays on your device. No cloud. No one listening."

---

### DEMO 1: Basic Dictation (0:18 - 0:35)

**[Screen: Open Notes app. Click into a blank note. Hold fn key — recording overlay appears.]**

**Drew:** "Here's how it works. I hold the fn key..."

**[Screen: The recording overlay pulses. Drew speaks into the mic:]**

**Drew (dictating):** "Hey Sarah, just wanted to follow up on our conversation from yesterday. Let me know if Thursday works for lunch."

**[Screen: Release fn key. "Transcribing..." overlay briefly appears. Text appears in Notes.]**

**Drew:** "...and that's it. I let go, and my words show up. No clicking, no menus, no setup."

---

### DEMO 2: Works Everywhere (0:35 - 0:48)

**[Screen: Quick cuts — hold fn and dictate a short phrase in each app:]**
1. **Messages** — "On my way, be there in ten"
2. **Safari (Gmail)** — "Thanks for sending that over"
3. **Google Docs** — "Chapter three, the beginning"

**Drew:** "It works in every app. Messages, email, documents, browsers — anywhere you can type, you can talk."

---

### DEMO 3: Smart Features (0:48 - 1:00)

**[Screen: Open Settings panel. Show the Transcription section — Smart Context toggle, Text Cleanup slider.]**

**Drew:** "MuttR cleans up your words automatically — removes filler, fixes punctuation. And it learns from what you've been typing to get the words right the first time."

**[Screen: Show Text Cleanup slider moving from Light to Aggressive.]**

**Drew:** "You choose how much cleanup you want. Light touch or full polish."

---

### PRIVACY (1:00 - 1:10)

**[Screen: Show Settings panel — could show the history section with encrypted entries, or just the clean settings UI.]**

**Drew:** "Everything runs on your Mac. Your voice never leaves this computer. Your transcriptions are encrypted and stored locally. We literally can't hear you — and that's the point."

---

### PRICING + CTA (1:10 - 1:25)

**[Screen: Show pricing on the website, or a clean graphic with the tiers.]**

**Drew:** "MuttR is free — 500 words a day, no credit card. Need more? Five bucks a month. Or grab a lifetime license and never think about it again."

**[Screen: Show the MuttR website download page, or the app icon with the download button.]**

**Drew:** "Download MuttR free at muttr dot app. Talk, don't type."

**[Screen: End card — MuttR icon centered, "muttr.app" below it, "Talk, don't type." tagline. Hold for 3 seconds.]**

## Post-Production Notes

### Editing
- **Pacing:** Keep it tight. Cut any dead air or hesitation. The video should feel fast but not rushed.
- **Transitions:** Simple cuts between apps. No fancy transitions — just clean cuts.
- **Text overlays:** Optional — can add small labels like "Notes", "Messages", "Gmail" when switching apps during the "works everywhere" section.
- **End card:** Static frame with MuttR icon + URL + tagline for 3-5 seconds.

### Audio
- **Voiceover volume:** Consistent throughout. Normalize audio.
- **Background music:** Start at 0:00, keep it low (15-20% volume). Fade out during dictation demos so viewers can hear the actual dictation. Fade back in for the privacy/pricing section.
- **Music suggestion:** Search "lo-fi ambient royalty free" on YouTube Audio Library or Artlist. Something warm and minimal.

### Thumbnail
- Mac screen at an angle showing MuttR's recording overlay
- Text overlay: "Talk, don't type." in white bold
- MuttR icon in the corner

- Drew's face (optional — videos with faces get higher CTR)
